## ðŸ›  Installation

To use this package, you must install **two components manually**:

---

### 1. Install the Altcha PHP wrapper

Install the backend verification library via Composer in your ConcreteCMS root directory:

```composer require altcha-org/altcha```

### 2. Include altcha.js manually
The Altcha frontend is not bundled automatically. You must manually copy the JavaScript and CSS into your ConcreteCMS package's asset folder.

Option A: Use npm (recommended)
1. Install Altcha in a temp folder:

```npm install altcha```

2. Copy the files:

```cp node_modules/altcha/dist/altcha.min.js packages/altcha_captcha/assets/js/altcha.js```
```cp node_modules/altcha/dist/altcha.css     packages/altcha_captcha/assets/css/altcha.css```

âœ… You may rename altcha.min.js to altcha.js to simplify asset registration.

Option B: Download manually
1. Visit the Altcha GitHub repository:
https://github.com/AltchaOrg/altcha

2. Download from the /dist directory:
- altcha.min.js
- altcha.css

3. Place them into your package:

- packages/altcha_captcha/assets/js/altcha.js
- packages/altcha_captcha/assets/css/altcha.css

The ConcreteCMS package registers these assets on load.

### 3. HMAC Key Setup
Altcha requires a secure 256-bit HMAC key to sign and verify challenges.

How to generate one:
Command line:
```openssl rand -hex 32```

Online generator:

Your key must be a 64-character hexadecimal string.
